Encode/decode numbers in strings so that they sort properly

## Why?

* Because sometimes you want items sorted in numeric order, even though they are sorted on a text field.  Example: filenames.
* Zero padding only works if your users are okay with lots of zeros, and/or you know your numbers will never get large.

## How?

1. Zero-pad to a reasonable amount -- like how big you think things will *probably* get in the life of the system
2. When you get bigger numbers, prefix them with a flagged length that keeps them sorting properly. The flag is an 'D' for every digit in the length counter, followed by the length counter, followed by a hyphen.

A few examples (more below):

|Number|Encoded with default setting {length: 4}|
|------|-------|
|1|0001|
|10|0010|
|100|0100|
|1000|1000|
|10000|D5-10000|
|100000000|D9-100000000|  
|1000000000|DD10-1000000000|
|1e+100|DDD101-10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000|

## API

```js
import {stringify, parse} from 'alpha-sortable'

console.log(stringify(20))
// => 0020

console.log(stringify(20, {length: 2}))
// => 20

console.log(stringify(20000000))
// => D8-20000000

console.log(parse('D8-20000000') === 20000000)
// true
```

## FAQ

### Q. Isn't there some standard way to do this?

A. Not that I could find.

### Q. Is there a maximum number it can handle?

A. No. For example, it could handle a googolplex by starting with a
googol 'D' characters. No problem!  (Of course, no computer in this
universe will ever be able to hold a number as large as a googolplex.)

### Q. Why 'D'

A. It standands for "digits".

It has to be a character that sorts after 9, which is most of them. I
thought about 'E', since this is similar to scientific notation, but
(1) that kind of seems like an error identifier, and (2) this is not
scientific notation.

### Q. Does the 'D' have to be uppercase?

A. Let's say yes. We don't have a clear example of where a lowercase D
would break something, but it seems like a bad idea.
